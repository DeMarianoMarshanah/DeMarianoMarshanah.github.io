<h2> Why did you enroll as an ICT student? why not other track or strands?</h2>

<p>I enroll as an ict student because i want to learn more about computer and i know that this is not easy to learn about computer but i can still try , and i can trust the process. Why not other track? Because I think I'm not good enough to take the other tracks I'm a slow learner hehe.</p>

<h2>What is your dream job? How do you think this course will help you in pursuing your career?</h2>

<p>My dream job when i was 13 years old is to become stewardess. Chasing your dreams is difficult because you will face discouragement. Many people and friends will discourage you because they will consider your pursuit unrealistic. Chasing your dreams will develop your courage. The secret of living is giving, if you follow your dreams then you will have something worth sharing with others, hope, inspiration and a meaning to live, and that to me, is a great contribution. </p>

<h2>To whom are you dedicating your success in finish course? Yourself, family, friends, special someone etc. why?</h2>

<p>I dedicate my success to my mama, because she's the only person that gives me strength when i was weak , she raised me well and my 3 siblings , the only person that all by my side through my ups and downs, and to give back I will give the success that she deserve. </p>
