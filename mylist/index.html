 <dt>All The Bright Places</dt>
 <dd>My highly recommended movie. the movie showed that sometimes the people closest to you can be going through a very hard time and you don't even realize it. </dd>
 <dt>Me Before You</dt>
 <dd>The movie is about how to enjoy every moment of your life when everything seems at an end. </dd>
 <dt>Seven Sundays</dt>
 <dd>Such a great movie that conveys a good message about family values.</dd>
 <dt>Suicide Squad</dt>
 <dd>The action in this movie is incredible. Itâ€™s violent, bloody, and just the thing that I wanted from a Suicide Squad movie!.</dd>
 <dt>Birds of Prey</dt>
 <dd>This movie is nice to watch because Margot Robbie nailed it.</dd>
